\section{Preliminaries}

In this thesis we want to discuss a very general problem arising from the combinatorical properties of polyhedra.
\begin{problem*} Given natural numbers $f_3$, $f_4$, \dots, $f_k$, does there exist a polyhedron with exactly $f_n$ $n$-gons for each $3 \leq n \leq k$.
\end{problem*}
A very powerful tool to answer this question is the Eulers relation.
\begin{theorem*}\label{eulers_relation}
\end{theorem*}


Let us consider the following problem:

\begin{problem*}[General Eberhard's problem]
\end{problem*}

Throughout the thesis we want to denote this problem as of $(f_1, f_2, ..., f_n)_p$-type.
